# AVR-projects
This repository contains a growing collection of individual AVR project files for various tasks. I personally use these projects as starting points for new microcontroller projects, or reference for common procedudures I usually have to go back to the datasheet for (timers, counters, frequency counting or synthesis, interrupts, UART, I2C, etc)

For more information on how I'm programming these chips, check out:
