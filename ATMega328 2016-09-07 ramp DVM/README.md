# Capacitor Charge Voltage Measurement
The idea behind this project is to measure a voltage by timing how long it takes to linearly charge a capacitor (using constant current charging) from 0V to the test voltage. This time is directly porportional to the test voltage. In this example, the AVR's internal comparator is utilized. Voltage is output through the serial port (TX pin)
