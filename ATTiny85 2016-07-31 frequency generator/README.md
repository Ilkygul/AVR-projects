# ATTiny85 Frequency Generator

A quick and dirty way to make an ATTiny85 microcontroller produce square waves at approximately 1Hz, 2Hz, 10Hz, 50Hz, and 1kHz. You can do something similar with an op-amp, but without a rail-to-rail op-amp it's not really convenient as a current source because it doesn't swing to zero. Also, most op-amp designs require negative voltages or virtual grounds. This is so easy, it's worth having. I label the chip with a sticker so I know what it is, and I store it on my workbench.
